  <h1><b>Project 2</b></h1>
  <h2><q>instructable</q></h2>
  <h3><i>Part 1 of 3</i></h3>
    <p>The first part of this homework assignment is to create an `index.html` by choosing to create a tutorial such as cooking, arts and crafts, or an acedemic lesson. I chose cooking.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Coding comes very easily to me. However, I did have a hard time with the <b>actual</b> instructions of what exactly the index is supposed to entail.<br />
  Is it:
    <ol>
      <li>creating a page content being the recipe?</li>
      <li>creating a page with the content being what I intend to do, sort of like this README?</li></P>
    </ol>
  <p>- I went with chocolate chip cookies, and the 1st part of the homework is   to simply put the ingrdients list on the home page.</p>
  <hr />
<h3><i>Part 2 of 3</i></h3>
  <p>Part 2 is alot of work.</P>
    <ol>
      <li>I went through and wrote 5 pages of notes and definitions.</li>
      <li>Then created the instructions page to the website.Wherer I made a table</li>
      <li>Now moving on to the form page to creat a comminity blog, sahring photos type thing.</li>
    </ol>
<h4>Images</h4>
  </p>-The incorporating images into a website was a breeze. I have been working with photshop and lightroom for <b>YEARS</b> and <i>image quality</i> and <i>pixels</i> and <i>vectors</i> is like a second language to me, I was excited to start bringing images into the picture ;)</p>
<h4>Tables</h4>
  <p>-tables are a little challening, but I think the trick is to just keep your code completley organized.</p>
<h4>Forms</h4>
  <p>-forms were easier to follow and didnt seem as time consuming.
    I did run into a probelm however : <br />
    <img src="../images/ss.png" alt="screenshot" title="screenshot" />
    `<textarea>` is messed up somewhow? i followed the formula of `<textarea> </textarea>` and i got an error saying that the special characters must me "escaped"? I can't find what i did wrong.. so I left it. will it effect what it looks like online, probley. we shall see.

  I haven't ran into any problems so far.
  I really cant wait to learn `CSS`.
  I want to learn how to change layouts and font types
  and in general, stylize the entire site to make it look less boring.
  Everytime I google somthing like "how to center text"
  it gives me the  `css` version first.
  So, I'm looking forward to the "design" part of this class!

<h1>Part 3/3</h1>

<p> this time I kind of had to rush to get it done, I keep looking to see if i have homework too late apparently becuase when i do its due by 11:55pm the same day. I work full-time have two babies. It gets a little insane.</p>
<br>
<p>i would have liked more time to maybe put in some style elmenets. </p>
<br>
<p>over all this project was great and im learning an insane amount.</p>
<h3>looking forward to CSS!</h3
