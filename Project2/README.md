  <h1><b>Project 2</b></h1>
  <h2><q>instructable</q></h2>
  <h3><i>Part 1 of 3<i></h3>
    <p>The first part of this homework assignment is to create an `index.html` by choosing to create a tutorial such as cooking, arts and crafts, or an acedemic lesson. I chose cooking.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Coding comes very easily to me. However, I did have a hard time with the <b>actual</b> instructions of what exactly the index is supposed to entail.<br />
  Is it:
    <ol>
      <li>creating a page content being the recipe?</li>
      <li>creating a page with the content being what I intend to do, sort of like this README?</li></P>
