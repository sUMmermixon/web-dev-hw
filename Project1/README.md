 **Reasons why I'm excited for more Web-Dev:**
1. So far, this is easy to follow! In a general sense I am very passionate about computers and design. With this class I kind of get to combine the two!
2. This is easy to understand. Computer terminololgies (?) is easy for me to grasp.
   * spelling is not my strong suit :(
3. Visual learning is my JAM.

**Unordered List:**
  * with dots
  * not numbers
