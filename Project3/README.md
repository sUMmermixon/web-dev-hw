<h1>PROJECT 3</h1>
<ul>
<li>I think I decided to do an article with photgraphy realted content. </li>
<br>
<li>For the material I am going to use
<a href="https://www.photographytalk.com">photgraphytalk.com</a>, I'm going to pick an article off there and sort of make it my own for mine. </li>
<br>
<li>The author I guess would be myself? But also I will taking some content from others... so not too sure what to cite for that. </li>
<br>
<li>Color is my favorite!! I love color palettes. I'm try these shades:
<img src="../images/blue.png" alt="color palette"> </li>
`images never freaking come up for me ....and im pulling my hair out.`
<br>
<br>
<li> I might do photography compostion article and i think i will take the photos myself. and edit them with the same color palette so that it flows.</li>

<li>I have seen differnt sites with very creative style to them. i really would like to learn how to make them unique like theres. The Media Arts website is awesome. I also like
<a href="https://shantellmartin.art">Shantell Martin's Website</a> HOW?? I wanna do this!! I might study this coding...</li>
<br>
<li>For fonts I <b>ALWAYS</b> use <a href="https://www.dafont.com">dafont.com</a> It's free and has literally every font imaginable.

<ul>
<li>CSS is knew to me. I thought  I would be excited to start learing the styling side of code but honestly its kind of difficult.
I dont know how to write what i want it to look like.</li>
<li>its taking me all day to just get the content on my index page.
<br />
<strong>I HAVE SO MUCH HOMWORK!</strong>
<br />
`i dont know if ill be done in time to turn it in Monday :(`
<li> I ran out of time.... its not where I would like it to be but, what do you do.
