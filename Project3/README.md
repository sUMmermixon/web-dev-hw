<h1>PROJECT 3</h1>
<ul>
<li>I think I decided to do an article with photgraphy realted content. </li>
<br>
<li>For the material I am going to use
<a href="https://www.photographytalk.com">photgraphytalk.com</a>, I'm going to pick an article off there and sort of make it my own for mine. </li>
<br>
<li>The author I guess would be myself? But also I will taking some content from others... so not too sure what to cite for that. </li>
<br>
<li>Color is my favorite!! I love color palettes. I'm try these shades:
<img src="../images/blue.png" alt="color palette"> </li>
`images never freaking come up for me ....and im pulling my hair out.`
<br>
<br>
<li> I might do photography compostion article and i think i will take the photos myself. and edit them with the same color palette so that it flows.</li>

<li>I have seen differnt sites with very creative style to them. i really would like to learn how to make them unique like theres. The Media Arts website is awesome. I also like
<a href="https://shantellmartin.art">Shantell Martin's Website</a> HOW?? I wanna do this!! I might study this coding...</li>
<br>
<li>For fonts I <b>ALWAYS</b> use <a href="https://www.dafont.com">dafont.com</a> It's free and has literally every font imaginable.

<h1> Part two</h1>

<ul>
<li>CSS is knew to me. I thought  I would be excited to start learing the styling side of code but honestly its kind of difficult.
I dont know how to write what i want it to look like.</li>
<li>its taking me all day to just get the content on my index page.
<br />
<strong>I HAVE SO MUCH HOMWORK!</strong>
<br />
`i dont know if ill be done in time to turn it in Monday :(`
<li> I ran out of time.... its not where I would like it to be but, what do you do.

<h1>Part Three</h1>
<li>Thank GOD this project is almost done. I just want to start over and be able to manage my time better. I work Full-time, i am in school full-Time, and im a full-time mom of two. i literally have barley enough time to even eat. I have a math test tomorrow, a project in illustrator due friday that i havent even started and I have a paper to write, oh and PART THREE FOR THIS CLASS IS DUE TOMORROW... gotta love college.</li>
<br />
<li>part three is due tomorrow and i barely even have part two done.</li>
<li> i sure got a faster paced class alright, thats what i get for opening my mouth</li>
<br />
<li> i have no layout.</li>
<br />
<li> THIS CLASS WOULD BE BETTER AND MORE ORGANIZED FOR STUDENTS WITH OUTRAGEOUSLY FULL SCHEDULES IF YOU COULD TELL US WHEN A PROJECTS STARTS AND ENDS. For Example: Project three part one starts 11/1 due 11/5 part two starts 11/5 due 11/10. THAT WAY SAID BUSY STUDENTS CAN TIME MAGANGE WHEN TO WORK ON THEIR ASSIGNMENTS. NOT BY GUESSING AND CHECKING WHEN SOMETHING IS UP AND THEN TRYING TO DO ALL OF THIS IN A DAY BECAUSE ITS DUE. </li>
