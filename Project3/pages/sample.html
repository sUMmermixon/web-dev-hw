    <td class="one"><font size="4"><center>Shoot Vertical and Horizontal</center></font>
      What I found to be most helpful is to take both a horizontal and a vertical shot of the same subject, and then compare how they look and feel afterward. It really helped me to develop my eye for framing and composition and it will do the same for you.
      Virtually all my landscape photos were in horizontal format and virtually all of my portraits were in vertical format.

There's nothing wrong with that approach; it's just expected. In photography, you want to give viewers something unexpected!

    <td> <img src="" alt="Rule 2" title="leading lines" width="600" height="300"/> </td>
    <td><font size="4"><center>Use Leading Lines</center></font>
      Leading lines are great because they help your viewers understand where they need to look in the photo.

  Rather than their eyes wandering around the shot, a leading line will immediately grab their attention, allowing you to direct them towards the primary subject.

  There are all sorts of lines you can use in a shot, from a roadway to a simple path to a fence or a wall.</td>

    <td> <img src="" alt="Rule 3" title="odd space" width="600" height="300"/> </td>
    <td><font size="4"><center>Rule of Thirds</center></font>
      As you likely already know, the Rule of Thirds states that you should avoid putting your subject in the middle of the frame.

  The reasoning is that having a subject in the middle creates photos that just aren't all that interesting with a static look and feel to them.

  Instead, by dividing the image into nine equal quadrants and placing the subject to the left or right of center (or above or below center), you'll get a more impactful image.</td>

    <td> <img src="" alt="Rule 4" title="filled frame" width="600" height="300"/> </td>
    <td><font size="4"><center>Fill the Frame</center></font>
      An easy way to create a more impactful composition (while keeping it simple as well) is to fill the frame with your subject.
Filling the frame gives a photo more impact because it eliminates all the clutter around it that might distract the viewer's eye.
There are several ways to fill the frame, including zooming in with your lens, getting closer to the subject by changing your shooting position, and cropping the image in post-processing.

In any case, filling the frame is a more unique way to compose a shot, and as a result, it will be immediately more interesting to view.

    <td> <img src="" alt="Rule 5" title="symmetry" width="600" height="300"/></td>
    <td><font size="4"><center>Symmetry</center></font>
    There is something in geometry and symmetry that accentuates a composition. That’s why the Golden Ratio is such a favorite among classical builders and painters. When you combine geometric shapes in an image with symmetry—so that the left and the right side of the images are balanced, such as in architecture photos—your composition becomes a whole lot more pleasing to the eye.</td>
